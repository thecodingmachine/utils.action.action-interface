    "description": "This package contains an interface used by many objects to say they can do stuff. Actually, they can perform one particular action and has been designed for that. The action performed is completely up to the implementer (sending a mail, storing a result in database, displaying something on the screen...) The concept is very simple, and very powerful at the same time.",
